## Technologies used
- The various technologies used are:
    - `JavaScript`
    - `HTML`
    - `Bootstraps` and additional `CSS`
### How the technologies have been implemented.

1) [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - JavaScript has been used in the validity and authentification of the credentials "inputted" during the login or signup process.
2) [**HTML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HTML has been used in the graphical birth of the website.
3) [**CSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) - CSS has been used in the
styling of the graphical components that have been used in the html.The styling includes setting sizes,colors,padding and even border radius of the components.
4) [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstartps has been used in providing the animations implemented in the website. This animations are shown at different circumstances for instance if you dont input your username or password, if the authentification is in process and if the login is successfull. 


## About the [`Login page`](https://thetrine333.github.io/kibu/)
 - As mentioned above you can login using a `username` and `password`.
 - The `username` and `password` are still with-held by the developer since the *backend* is still under **construction** but, You could login as a guest using "**Guest**" as the username and password and this should take you to the developers [github](https://github.com/) profile page. Here you can follow the developer to show support for the hardwork he's doing and give some of his project a ‚≠ê.

## About the [`Register page`](https://thetrine333.github.io/kibu/pages/reg.html)

- Here it's similar to the [login page](https://thetrine333.github.io/kibu/), only that you are making a new account and so you need to do some clarifications, and therefor you must submit your `username`,`email`,`fullname`,`phone number`,`a valid cv`and `password` for your account.
